Revision history for the toolkit act-starter-debian

0.00_06 2019-10-07 Switching to act-testing repositories

 - The fork has been moved to https://github.com/act-testing/Act.
   The old address still works but should be phased out.

0.00_05 2019-05-09 Adapting to stage1

 - The default branch is now stage1 at https://github.com/HaraldJoerg/Act
 - The Act manual is now created during installation
   and made available at http://localhost:5000/manual/Manual.html.

0.00_04 2019-04-18 Fixed broken test & doc update

 - Due to a bad change which wasn't intended to be committed
   the Act test t/02config.t reported:
   "not ok 40 - compiled templates directory exists!".
   Reported by Paul Cochrane (thanks!).
   This is now fixed by using the default directory.
 - Added a hint that the homepage of the plackup server
   has no content (also reported by Paul Cochrane).

0.00_03 2019-04-17 Default branch is now stage0

 - From now on, this repository will always point to
   the latest "release" of Act evolution.

0.00_02 2019-04-06 No more Bcrypt params in act,ini

 - The Bcrypt parameters in act.ini which have been
   introduced in the psgi branch in 2011 are no
   longer needed in https://github.com/HaraldJoerg/Act
   (branch "evolution", as of tag eliminate_bcrypt_params).
   Therefore, they could be deleted from the provisioning.

0.00_01 2019-04-03 New GitHub repository

 - Unreleased - there's nowhere to release it to
 - Announced to https://wiki.perlcon.eu
